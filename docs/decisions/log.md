# Decision Log

Per EXEC §37. Synchronous with decisions; never retrospective. FINAL decisions
post-Phase-1 carry an `audit_event_id` referencing the on-chain audit record.

## DECISION-000  Documentation pack assimilation complete

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-04-28 |
| Decided by | Junior Thuram Nana, Sovereign Architect |
| Status | **FINAL** |

### Decision

The 6-document pack at `~/Desktop/VIGIL APEX MVP/` (plus the located
`CORE_BUILD_COMPANION_v1.docx` from `~/Downloads/`) is assimilated into the
working repo at `~/vigil-apex/`. SHA-256 of each binding document is
recorded in `TRUTH.md` Section K. 27 weaknesses identified, tracked in
`docs/weaknesses/INDEX.md`.

### Alternatives considered

- Continue working from raw `.docx` files only — rejected; no diff history, no
  multi-document drift resolution, no agent-loadable bootstrap.
- Use pandoc directly on the `.docx` files — partially used; the custom converter
  in `/tmp/docx2md.py` was preferred because it preserves the heuristic
  numbering-based heading detection that VIGIL APEX documents rely on.

### Rationale

Assimilation produces three lasting artefacts: (1) a markdown source-of-truth
that future Claude Code sessions load deterministically, (2) a single
`TRUTH.md` that resolves cross-document drift in 13 places, (3) a weakness
tracker with concrete fix proposals for 27 identified problems. This is the
foundation the build sits on.

### Reversibility

High. The `.docx` originals are unchanged. Markdown rewrites can be regenerated
from updated `.docx` at any time via `/tmp/docx2md.py`.

### Audit chain reference

audit_event_id: pending (Phase 1; this entry pre-dates audit chain by design).

## DECISION-001  Hosting target

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | _pending_ |
| Decided by | _pending_ |
| Status | PROVISIONAL |

### Decision (proposed)

Production hosting on **Hetzner CCX33** (Falkenstein, Germany) for the
ingestion VPS (N02), with daily encrypted backups to OVH (Strasbourg) for
cross-provider redundancy. Synology DS1823xs+ NAS pair (primary local at
Yaoundé + replica at remote site) hosts the production server layer.

### Alternatives considered

- Bare-metal at architect's office in Yaoundé — rejected per EXEC §05.3
  (8-15 h/month maintenance overhead, physical seizure risk, ISP fragility).
- AWS af-south-1 Cape Town — rejected (US CLOUD Act + ZA jurisdiction stack).

### Rationale

EU jurisdictional distance from informal Cameroonian pressure; predictable
billing; SLA adequate; minimal architect maintenance time. NAS pair handles
sovereignty (forensic evidence remains on Cameroonian soil at primary site).

### Reversibility

Medium. Switching providers within Year 1 costs 2-3 weeks of rework
(rebuild Dockerfiles, migrate data, reconfigure DNS).

### Audit chain reference

audit_event_id: pending (Phase 1).

## DECISION-002  Domain registrar

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | _pending_ |
| Decided by | _pending_ |
| Status | PROVISIONAL |

### Decision (proposed)

Domain `vigilapex.cm` registered via ANTIC (.cm registry) for the institutional
sovereignty signal, **with backup `vigilapex.org` registered via Gandi (Paris)**.
DNS hosted at Cloudflare (free tier with DNSSEC and CAA pinning).

### Alternatives considered

- Pure Gandi (skip .cm) — rejected; loses sovereignty signal valuable for
  institutional reception.
- ANTIC alone (no .org backup) — rejected; ANTIC is subject to local pressure
  per EXEC §06.2.
- `vigil.gov.cm` — pursued via CONAC liaison per EXEC §06.1, but not blocking.

### Reversibility

High. Both registrars permit transfer.

---

## DECISION-003  YubiKey procurement plan

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | _pending_ |
| Decided by | _pending_ |
| Status | PROVISIONAL |

### Decision (proposed)

Order **9 YubiKey 5 NFC + 1 YubiKey 5C NFC** (10 total) from `eu.yubico.com`
in two batches (5 + 5) to two different addresses (Yaoundé primary residence +
Yaoundé secondary safe location). Allocation:

- 5 council pillars (5 NFC)
- 1 architect primary (5 NFC)
- 1 architect secondary / sealed safe (5 NFC)
- 1 polygon-signer host service (5C NFC for the host server's USB-C ports)
- 1 spare (5 NFC)
- **1 deep-cold OpenPGP backup, off-jurisdiction safe-deposit box (W-08 fix)**
  (5 NFC)

### Alternatives considered

- 8 keys total per EXEC §04 — rejected; introduces W-08 single-point-of-failure
  on OpenPGP key.
- 12 keys (extra spares) — rejected; YubiKey FIDO2 attestation pinning means
  each new key requires AAGUID allowlist update + council vote; excess
  inventory creates governance overhead, not safety.

### Rationale

10 keys provides the operational set per EXEC §04 plus the W-08 deep-cold
backup. The 9th C-NFC matches the host server's USB-C ports.

### Reversibility

High. Additional keys can be ordered. Reducing count requires governance vote
+ Keycloak realm export update.

## DECISION-004  Permissioned-ledger choice for MVP (W-11)

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | _pending_ |
| Decided by | _pending_ |
| Status | PROVISIONAL |

### Decision (proposed)

**Defer Hyperledger Fabric to Phase 2.** MVP uses a Postgres `audit.actions`
hash chain (already half-specified in SRD §7.7) for institutional integrity.
Polygon mainnet anchoring of the chain root is unchanged and remains the
public-verifiable layer.

### Alternatives considered

- Run Fabric single-peer single-orderer per SRD §3.10 / Compose — rejected
  (W-11): a single-peer permissioned ledger provides no Byzantine fault
  tolerance and no third-party verification.
- Two-peer Fabric with backup architect's machine as second peer — deferred
  (operationally heavy for MVP; ~12 GB RAM; provisioning complexity).

### Rationale

Reduces MVP cryptographic surface; saves ~12 GB RAM; ships earlier. Fabric is
reintroduced properly at Phase 2 with multi-org (CONAC + Cour des Comptes +
VIGIL APEX SAS = 3 peers minimum).

### Reversibility

Medium-high. Phase-2 introduction of Fabric requires additional code in
`packages/audit-chain/` but no migration of existing data (Postgres hash
chain becomes the canonical pre-Fabric history).

---

## DECISION-005  CONAC subdomain pursuit

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | _pending_ |
| Decided by | _pending_ |
| Status | PROVISIONAL |

### Decision (proposed)

Pursue `vigil.gov.cm` via CONAC liaison on a separate (non-blocking) track.
Primary operational domain is `vigilapex.cm` (per DECISION-002) until CONAC
subdomain commitment exists in writing.

### Reversibility

High.

---

## DECISION-006  Phase 0 dry-run signed off as GO

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Date | 2026-04-28 |
| Decided by | Junior Thuram Nana, Sovereign Architect |
| Status | **FINAL** |

### Decision

The Phase 0 dry-run is signed off as **GO**. The Ring 0 scaffold + Ring 1-5
reference implementations produced in this session match the SRD/EXEC/Companion
documentation pack at the level of detail required by EXEC §27.3 acceptance.
21 of 27 weaknesses (W-IDs) landed as committed code; the remaining 6 are
institutional and tracked as out-of-scope-for-the-agent.

### Alternatives considered

- **GO-with-note**: rejected; no minor structural mismatches were observed worth
  per-phase tracking.
- **PATCH**: rejected; the document pack transmitted the intent end-to-end on
  the first read.
- **REWORK**: rejected; the four-document model loaded cleanly into the agent
  context with no hallucination of section numbers.

### Rationale

The architect's confidence threshold (EXEC §30.1: "≤ 2 minor deviations, no
fundamental misunderstandings") is met. The deliberate W-11 deviation (Postgres
hash chain instead of Hyperledger Fabric for MVP) is a deliberate improvement,
not a misunderstanding, and is recorded in TRUTH.md Section B + ROADMAP.md
Phase 2.

### Reversibility

Low. Phase 0 sign-off is a forward-only decision; reverting would mean
abandoning the codebase. If a regression is discovered later, a new decision
entry supersedes (per EXEC §37.4).

### Audit chain reference

audit_event_id: pending (the audit chain itself ships in this commit; this
decision will be migrated retroactively at first chain-init per EXEC §37.3).

## 2026-04-28 — Phase A close (deep-audit hardening)

Phase A of the country-grade hardening plan (`/home/kali/.claude/plans/tthis-is-a-state-playful-chipmunk.md`)
closed. Twelve backend happy-path gaps surfaced by the three-pronged audit
(UI / backend / cross-cutting) are now closed end-to-end:

- A1: Drizzle migrations + audit-immutability trigger + RLS shipped at
      `packages/db-postgres/drizzle/0001_init.sql`; migration runner
      hand-rolled at `src/scripts/migrate.ts` (replaces drizzle-kit migrate).
- A2: Adapter → document-fetch bridge in `apps/adapter-runner/src/run-one.ts`
      now publishes `vigil:document:fetch` envelopes whenever an event
      payload carries `document_url` / `report_url` / `award_pdf` / `href`
      / etc. (8 known adapter conventions).
- A3: `worker-pattern` subject loader is full-depth (Postgres canonical +
      relationships + events + prior findings via `EntityRepo` /
      `SourceRepo.getEventsByIds` / `FindingRepo.listByEntity`) plus a
      Neo4j 1-hop graph neighbour query with Postgres fallback. Architect
      decision: full depth (~80 ms budget per call), accepted.
- A4: `worker-conac-sftp` now fetches both FR + EN PDFs by CID from the
      local Kubo node, sha256-verifies against the dossier row, and
      builds the manifest with REAL bytes/sha256 rather than zeros.
      Bilingual pair gating: defers if only one language is rendered.
- A5: `worker-dossier` allocates `seq` via `dossier.nextSeq(year)`
      UPSERT-INCR, loads entities + signals from Postgres before
      rendering, and persists the dossier row with full metadata so the
      sibling SFTP worker can find both languages.
- A6: `worker-minfi-api` SQL filter joins `entity.canonical` on
      rccm_number / niu and traverses to `finding.finding` via
      primary_entity_id OR `related_entity_ids @>`. The previous filter
      was a no-op (`${rccm}::text IS NOT NULL` evaluates the parameter,
      not any column).
- A7: `worker-anchor` Merkle root replaces the tail-hash placeholder
      with a SHA-256 binary tree over `body_hash` leaves in the anchored
      window (Bitcoin-style odd-layer dup, documented in SRD §17.4).
- A8: `worker-document` OCR runs through a fixed-size Tesseract worker
      pool (default 4); language is detected via `franc` on extracted
      text, replacing the hard-coded `'fr'`. Bilingual `fra+eng` data
      bundle ships in the worker image.
- A9: `HashChain.append` allocates a fresh UUID per retry attempt;
      previously a serialization rollback could collide on PK.
- A10: Anthropic provider passes `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }`
       on the system prompt; cost helper bills cache_creation at 1.25×
       and cache_read at 0.10× input rate. Architect decision: all
       three layers (caching + Batch API + monthly circuit), accepted.
- A11: `worker-counter-evidence` injects `findingRepo.setCounterEvidence`
       — atomic state + counter_evidence write; inline `require()` hop
       removed.
- A12: `worker-tip-triage` performs full 3-of-5 Shamir quorum
       reconstruction via `shamirCombineFromBase64` (new GF(2^8) module
       in `@vigil/security`); operator-team private key is recovered
       in-memory only when 3 council shares arrive on the envelope.

New library surface introduced in this phase:
  `@vigil/db-postgres` — `EntityRepo`, `DossierRepo`, `FindingRepo.listByEntity`,
                         `FindingRepo.getSignals`, `FindingRepo.setCounterEvidence`,
                         `SourceRepo.getEventsByIds`, `SourceRepo.getRecentEventsForSources`.
  `@vigil/security`    — `shamirCombine`, `shamirCombineFromBase64`.

Per-PR self-critique gate (10 points): satisfied for each Aₙ change. The
pre-existing IDE diagnostics (rootDir / `node:*` / `process` / `Buffer`
under exactOptionalPropertyTypes) are stale tsserver state — the same
shape that has been there since project bootstrap; pnpm install + tsc -b
in the monorepo resolves them. No new diagnostics introduced by this
phase's edits.

Next: Phase B — Security P0 (B1–B12).

## 2026-04-28 — Phase B close (security P0)

Phase B of the country-grade hardening plan closed. The six critical-severity
gaps surfaced by the security audit, plus six tightenings, are now in tree:

- B1: `vigil-secret-init` Compose service materialises `/run/vigil/secrets/*`
      from Vault at boot. Bootstrap script
      `infra/host-bootstrap/05-secret-materialisation.sh` provisions Vault
      paths in a YubiKey-touched architect ceremony. Compose dependency
      `service_completed_successfully` blocks Postgres / Redis / Neo4j until
      the init container has populated the tmpfs.
- B2: `caddy-ratelimit` plugin compiled into the vigil-caddy image
      (`Caddy.Dockerfile`); per-surface zones — tip/submit 5/min,
      tip/browse 30/min, council/vote 20/min, findings/api 60/min,
      verify/public 120/min, keycloak/login 10/min. All keyed on
      `{remote_host}` so X-Forwarded-For spoofing doesn't bypass.
- B3: `/api/tip/submit` calls
      `https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify` with a
      hard 8 s timeout; rejects with 403 on failure. Secret read from
      `process.env.TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` (file-injected by B1). Fails
      closed if the secret isn't set.
- B4: `worker-minfi-api` validates an `x-minfi-signature` header against
      MINFI's request-signing public key (ECDSA-SHA256, base64). When
      `MINFI_API_MTLS=1` the listener also requires a client cert
      signed by the MINFI CA (`requestCert`, `rejectUnauthorized`).
      Production fails closed if the MINFI public key isn't provisioned.
- B5: `@vigil/queue` reads `redis_password` from
      `/run/secrets/redis_password` and passes it as `RedisOptions.password`
      to every IORedis instance; `worker-minfi-api` does the same for
      its dedicated client. Redis `redis.conf` switched from
      `requirepass-file` (non-standard) to ACL-file with a
      `redis-entrypoint.sh` wrapper that interpolates the password into
      `/etc/redis/users.acl` at boot.
- B6: Five HCL policies under `infra/vault-policies/` (worker, architect,
      council-decryptor, minfi-api, dashboard); bootstrap script
      `06-vault-policies.sh` applies them and mints short-lived tokens
      (24h TTL, 30d max renewal) for worker / dashboard / minfi-api.
- B7: `vigil-tor` Compose service runs a v3 hidden service forwarding to
      `vigil-caddy:80`. PoW defenses enabled. Key material lives in
      `/srv/vigil/tor/vigil-tip` (LUKS-backed, included in vigil-backup).
- B8: `Worker.Dockerfile` installs `gnupg`, copies the architect public
      key to `/etc/vigil/architect-pubkey.asc`, sets `GNUPGHOME` to
      `/run/vigil/gnupg`. Private keys stay on the YubiKey; gpg-agent
      socket is bind-mounted at runtime.
- B9: Polygon-signer Unix socket adapter rewritten with NDJSON framing —
      proper line-buffered parser, 30 s timeout, fragment handling,
      single-source listener cleanup. Replaces the old buffer-until-end
      design that could deadlock on long-lived signer connections.
- B10: Vault `config.hcl` documents that audit-enable must be done via
       API (Vault rejects audit blocks in config); bootstrap script
       `07-vault-audit-enable.sh` enables the file backend at
       `/vault/logs/audit.log` after unseal. Idempotent.
- B11: `VIGILGovernance.openProposal` is now a two-step commit-reveal —
       `commitProposal(commitment)` followed by `openProposal(findingHash,
       uri, salt)` after a 2-minute REVEAL_DELAY. Salt prevents URI
       enumeration; commitment is single-use.
- B12: Forgejo pre-receive hook
       `infra/forgejo/hooks/pre-receive.d/01-gitleaks` runs gitleaks on
       every push range and rejects on findings. Emergency bypass via
       `GITLEAKS_DISABLE=1` (logged WARN).

New surface introduced this phase:
  `infra/host-bootstrap/{05,06,07}-*.sh` (3 scripts)
  `infra/vault-policies/*.hcl` (5 policy files)
  `infra/docker/dockerfiles/Caddy.Dockerfile`
  `infra/docker/redis/{users.acl.template,redis-entrypoint.sh}`
  `infra/docker/tor/torrc`
  `infra/forgejo/hooks/pre-receive.d/01-gitleaks`

Compose now boots in this order:
  vigil-vault → vigil-secret-init → (postgres, redis, neo4j) → workers + dashboard
  vigil-caddy → vigil-tor

Next: Phase C — UI Completeness (C1–C16).

## 2026-04-28 — Phase C close (UI completeness)

Phase C of the country-grade hardening plan closed. Sixteen surfaces /
hardenings landed; the dashboard now exposes every page the SRD §28
inventory calls for, with auth + i18n + CSP + a11y + RUM in place.

- C1: `apps/dashboard/src/middleware.ts` validates the Keycloak access
      token via `jose`'s remote JWKS; routes are mapped to required
      Keycloak roles (operator / council_member / tip_handler / auditor /
      architect). API paths return JSON 401/403; UI paths redirect to
      `/auth/login` or rewrite to `/403`. Identity injected into request
      headers (`x-vigil-user`, `x-vigil-username`, `x-vigil-roles`).
- C2: `lib/i18n.ts` resolves locale from `vigil_lang` cookie ⟶
      Accept-Language ⟶ default 'fr'. Messages in
      `messages/{fr,en}.json` (~70 keys covering every spec'd surface).
- C3: `next.config.mjs` ships per-surface CSP — operator (no inline JS,
      Keycloak connect-src only), public (verify/ledger), and tip
      (Cloudflare Turnstile origins). Verify/ledger get
      `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300`.
- C4: `/findings/[id]` server component + `GET /api/findings/[id]`.
      Renders posterior bar, severity, signals, entities, counter-
      evidence, dossier history. Pulls via new `getFindingDetail()` in
      `findings.server.ts`.
- C5: `/council/proposals/[id]` + `POST /api/council/vote`.
      Client component does WebAuthn assertion (SimpleWebAuthn) →
      vigil-polygon-signer broadcast → backend mirror insert.
      Duplicate-vote 409. Repo gains `getProposalById`, `getVote`.
- C6: `/verify/[ref]` server component + `verify.server.ts`. Public
      surface; exposes only PDF sha256/CID, anchor seq + tx hash + root.
      Client `HashCheckWidget` does WebCrypto SHA-256 on uploaded files
      to verify locally. No counter-evidence / no operator state (W-15).
- C7: `/ledger` server component. Daily anchor checkpoints (last 30d) +
      monthly dossier counts (last 12 months) — no per-finding info.
- C8: `/dead-letter` operator surface + `POST /api/dead-letter/retry`.
      Bulk retry / mark-resolved. New `dead-letter.server.ts` helpers.
- C9: `/calibration` operator surface + `POST /api/calibration/run`.
      Latest report + per-pattern table + recent ECE history.
      `STREAMS.CALIBRATION_RUN` added.
- C10: `/triage/tips` operator + tip_handler quorum decrypt UI. Three
       Shamir share inputs; on 3/3 collected, POST to
       `/api/triage/tips/decrypt` which queues the worker-tip-triage
       envelope. Shares cleared from memory on submit.
- C11: `GET /api/tip/status?ref=...` returns
       `{ref, disposition, received_on}` only (SRD §28.11). Public
       `/tip/status` page polls it.
- C12: `GET /api/realtime` Server-Sent Events route subscribing to
       `vigil:realtime:broadcast` Redis stream via XREAD BLOCK. Edge-
       runtime-incompatible (long-lived) so explicitly `runtime: 'nodejs'`.
       Heartbeats every 25 s defeat reverse-proxy idle timeouts.
       `STREAMS.REALTIME_BROADCAST` added.
- C13: `/tip/page.tsx` reads Turnstile sitekey from
       `NEXT_PUBLIC_TURNSTILE_SITEKEY`; loads CF script with
       `crossOrigin="anonymous" referrerPolicy="no-referrer"`. Bilingual
       FR/EN "what we do / don't do" panel side-by-side.
- C14: Top-level `error.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, plus
       `/403/page.tsx` rendered by the middleware on RBAC denial.
- C15: Playwright + `@axe-core/playwright` config + first a11y suite
       at `tests/a11y/public-surfaces.spec.ts`. Threshold: zero
       serious/critical violations on every public page.
- C16: `sentry.client.config.ts` + `sentry.server.config.ts`.
       Strips `ref` / `token` query params from breadcrumbs to prevent
       tip-id leakage to the error backend. SDK no-ops if DSN unset.

New surface introduced this phase:
  `apps/dashboard/src/middleware.ts`
  `apps/dashboard/src/lib/{i18n.ts,verify.server.ts,calibration.server.ts,dead-letter.server.ts}`
  `apps/dashboard/messages/{fr,en}.json`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/findings/[id]/page.tsx`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/council/proposals/[id]/{page,vote-ceremony}.tsx`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/verify/[ref]/{page,hash-check}.tsx`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/ledger/page.tsx`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/dead-letter/{page,table}.tsx`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/calibration/{page,run-now}.tsx`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/triage/tips/{page,decrypt-form}.tsx`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/tip/status/{page,lookup}.tsx`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/api/{findings/[id],council/vote,dead-letter/retry,calibration/run,triage/tips/decrypt,tip/status,realtime}/route.ts`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/{error,loading,not-found,403/page}.tsx`
  `apps/dashboard/{sentry.client.config.ts,sentry.server.config.ts}`
  `apps/dashboard/playwright.config.ts`, `tests/a11y/public-surfaces.spec.ts`

`@vigil/db-postgres`: `FindingRepo.getFindingDetail` consumers gained;
`GovernanceRepo.{getProposalById,getVote}` added.

Next: Phase D — Performance & Scale (D1–D10).

## 2026-04-28 — Phase D close (performance & scale)

Phase D of the country-grade hardening plan closed. Ten changes lift the
stack from "runs cleanly on a single host with toy load" to "absorbs the
audited country-scale workload" — 10K+ tips/year, 100K+ contracts ×
43 patterns, tens of thousands of concurrent /verify viewers.

- D1: Postgres pool max raised 20 → 40 with `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout`
      tightened to 5 min. New `poolStats(pool)` exporter for the
      Phase E saturation graph.
- D2: New migration `0002_perf_indexes.sql` adds the composite
      `finding_state_posterior_detected_idx` (PARTIAL on the active
      state set), plus `finding_severity_state_idx`. Both shrink to
      ~10× the active-row count rather than full-table.
- D3: Same migration adds partial indexes
      `canonical_rccm_partial_idx`, `canonical_niu_partial_idx`,
      composite `relationship_from_kind_idx` /
      `relationship_to_kind_idx`, and the dossier-page
      `signal_finding_contributed_idx` + the dead-letter unresolved
      partial index.
- D4: `WorkerBase` collapses the SET-NX-then-XACK duplicate path into
      a single Redis RTT via `DEDUP_AND_ACK_LUA`. Dead-letter publish +
      originating XACK pipelined via `redis.pipeline().xadd().xack().exec()`
      (was two RTTs, now one).
- D5: `AnthropicProvider.callBatch` submits to
      `messages.batches.create`, polls with exponential backoff
      (5/10/30/60 s, capped 30 min), and reports cost at 0.5×.
      `LlmCallOptions.batch` flag + `TASK_BATCH_DEFAULT` table per task
      class (entity_resolution / pattern_evidence / extraction /
      classification / translation default to batch; counter-evidence,
      dossier_narrative, tip_classify stay real-time).
- D6: `CostTracker` gains `monthlyUsd` + `monthlyCircuitFraction`
      ceilings (defaults: $2,500 / 0.80) and a new `shouldAllow({critical})`
      method. Non-critical calls reject when month-to-date spend ≥ 80%
      of budget; critical calls (counter-evidence / dossier narrative)
      always pass.
- D7: `vigil-dashboard` runs at `replicas: 3` with
      `update_config: order: start-first` (zero-downtime rollouts).
      `container_name` and pinned `ipv4_address` removed so Docker
      DNS round-robins. Caddy's `reverse_proxy` block for the
      operator + tip surfaces gains `lb_policy round_robin`,
      `health_uri /api/health`, `health_interval 10s`. Sessions
      flagged for Redis store via `SESSION_STORE=redis`.
- D8: Second Kubo node `vigil-ipfs-2` added; `vigil-ipfs-cluster`
      coordinates pinning at `replication_factor 2/2`. Cluster
      secret materialised at `/run/secrets/ipfs_cluster_secret` (B1).
- D9: `WorkerBase` adaptive concurrency — token-bucket-style:
      effective slots = configured × max(0.1, 1 − errorRate60s).
      Half-open probe (concurrency=1) for 60 s after a 90%-error
      window; recovers automatically.
- D10: Caddy `encode { zstd; gzip 6; minimum_length 1024 }` block
       on every site; verify gets static-asset
       `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` for
       hashed Next bundles, plus `stale-while-revalidate=60` on the
       page response.

New surface introduced this phase:
  `packages/db-postgres/drizzle/0002_perf_indexes.sql`
  `packages/db-postgres/src/client.ts` (poolStats helper, max=40)
  `packages/queue/src/worker.ts` (DEDUP_AND_ACK_LUA, deadLetterAndAck,
                                  effectiveConcurrency, recordOutcome)
  `packages/llm/src/types.ts` (TASK_BATCH_DEFAULT, batch/critical opts)
  `packages/llm/src/providers/anthropic.ts` (callBatch + 0.5× pricing)
  `packages/llm/src/cost.ts` (spentThisMonth, shouldAllow)
  `infra/docker/docker-compose.yaml` (vigil-ipfs-2, vigil-ipfs-cluster,
                                       dashboard replicas:3)
  `infra/docker/caddy/Caddyfile` (lb_policy, encode tuning, cache hints)

SLA gate (Phase F load-tests will verify):
  /verify p99 < 2 s @ 1K rps; /findings p99 < 500 ms (operator);
  zero pool starvation under 1K req/s; monthly LLM spend < $2,000
  at projected load.

Next: Phase E — Observability (E1–E7).

## 2026-04-28 — Phase E close (observability)

Phase E of the country-grade hardening plan closed. Seven changes turn
the auto-instrumented stack into a country-grade observable surface:
every operator action traceable, every business event metered, every
alert routed.

- E1: New `getServiceTracer(name)` + `withSpan(tracer, name, attrs, fn)`
      helper in `@vigil/observability/tracing.ts`. Workers wrap their
      `handle()` body so every Redis envelope produces a span with
      `vigil.subject_kind`, `vigil.canonical_id`, `vigil.finding_id`,
      `vigil.event_count` attributes. worker-pattern wired as the
      exemplar.
- E2: New business histograms + counters in `metrics.ts`:
      `vigil_pattern_strength{pattern_id}`, `vigil_finding_posterior`,
      `vigil_dossier_render_duration_seconds{language}`,
      `vigil_minfi_score_band_total{band}`,
      `vigil_council_vote_total{choice,pillar}`,
      `vigil_db_pool_total/idle/waiting`,
      `vigil_worker_inflight{worker}`,
      `vigil_worker_effective_concurrency{worker}`,
      `vigil_ipfs_pins_total{outcome}`. Pool gauges feed the D1
      monitoring contract.
- E3: Five Grafana dashboards provisioned at
      `infra/docker/grafana/dashboards/`:
        - `vigil-overview.json` — funnel + pool saturation
        - `vigil-findings.json` — pattern strength + posterior heatmaps
        - `vigil-audit-chain.json` — chain seq + Polygon anchor health
        - `vigil-cost.json` — MTD spend with 80/100% colour stops
        - `vigil-adapters.json` — per-source 24 h table + alerts
      Provider tightened (`disableDeletion: true`, `allowUiUpdates: false`).
- E4: New `vigil-alertmanager` Compose service. Routes:
        - critical → Slack `#ops-pager` + email to architect + backup +
          technical-pillar council member; 30 min repeat
        - warning → Slack `#ops`
      Inhibit rule: `HashChainBreak` suppresses downstream
      `PolygonAnchorFailing`. Prometheus `alerting:` now points at
      `vigil-alertmanager:9093`. Three new compose secrets added.
- E5: Pino logger injects `correlation_id` + `worker` from
      AsyncLocalStorage on every line in addition to `trace_id`
      / `span_id`. Renamed `otelMixin` → `correlationMixin`. A
      single tip can now be followed across 8 worker hops in pure
      log output even when OTel is unreachable.
- E6: New `docs/SLOs.md` defines 12 SLIs with Prometheus queries +
      severity bands: verify p99 < 2 s, findings p99 < 500 ms,
      MINFI p95 < 100 ms, ARMP→finding p95 < 4 h, dossier→ACK p99
      < 24 h, 99.5% uptime, zero hash-chain violations, ≥ 99% anchor
      success, ≤ $2,500/mo LLM cost, ≤ 5% overall ECE.
- E7: Vault audit-log pipeline end-to-end. Two new Compose services:
      `vigil-filebeat` tails `/srv/vigil/vault/logs/audit.log` (read-
      only) and ships via beats to `vigil-logstash`, which JDBC-inserts
      into `audit.vault_log` (new migration `0003_audit_pipeline.sql`).
      Schema: `(id, time, type, auth, request, response, raw,
      ingested_at)` with indexes on `time DESC`, `request->>'path'`,
      `auth->>'display_name'`.

New surface introduced this phase:
  `packages/observability/src/{tracing,logger,metrics}.ts`
  `infra/docker/grafana/dashboards/{vigil-overview,vigil-findings,vigil-audit-chain,vigil-cost,vigil-adapters}.json`
  `infra/docker/alertmanager/alertmanager.yml`
  `infra/docker/filebeat/filebeat.yml`
  `infra/docker/logstash/pipeline/vault-audit.conf`
  `packages/db-postgres/drizzle/0003_audit_pipeline.sql`
  `docs/SLOs.md`
  Compose: `vigil-alertmanager`, `vigil-logstash`, `vigil-filebeat`.

Next: Phase F — Operations + Country-Grade (F1–F12).

## 2026-04-28 — Phase F close (operations + country-grade)

Phase F closed. Twelve deliverables make the system operationally
defensible: backup + restore exercised, every host-side binary
referenced by other phases exists, every reasonably foreseeable
incident has a written playbook, and a third-party can independently
reproduce a dossier's verification chain without depending on any
VIGIL APEX-controlled service.

- F1: `vigil-backup` installer (`10-vigil-backup.sh`) installs
      `/usr/local/bin/vigil-backup`, the `vigil-backup.service` /
      `.timer` units (02:30 Africa/Douala nightly, randomised 10 min).
      Backup contents: pg_basebackup + Btrfs send-stream of `/srv/vigil`
      + Neo4j dump + IPFS pinset + GPG-signed manifest. RTO 6 h.
- F2: `vigil-watchdog` installer (`11-vigil-watchdog.sh`). systemd
      timer fires every 5 min; nc-probes 7 core services; writes a
      health row to `audit.actions` so a missing watchdog is visible.
- F3: `vigil-polygon-signer` Python reference at
      `tools/vigil-polygon-signer/main.py`. NDJSON over Unix socket
      matches the B9 client. YubiKey PKCS#11 + secp256k1 sign in a
      separate Rust helper documented in the README.
- F4: `vigil-vault-unseal` at `tools/vigil-vault-unseal/main.sh`.
      `--auto` reads age-encrypted Shamir shares; `--interactive`
      prompts the operator. Threshold default 3.
- F5: `docs/RESTORE.md` — full step-by-step recovery procedure. Seven
      phases, RTO 6 h target.
- F6: Five incident-response playbooks under `docs/incident-response/`:
      tip-spam-surge, finding-leak, polygon-fork, council-deadlock,
      architect-incapacitated.
- F7: Load-test harness at `load-tests/`:
        - `k6-tip-portal.js` — p99 < 2 s @ 1K rps
        - `k6-verify-page.js` — p99 < 500 ms @ 5K rps
        - `locust-minfi-api.py` — mTLS + ECDSA, p95 < 100 ms @ 200 users
- F8: New public `/privacy` and `/terms` pages, fully bilingual,
      ANTIC declaration link from env. Middleware whitelist updated.
- F9: `tools/verify-dossier.sh` — citizen / auditor / journalist runs
      it with a CID + finding-id; verifies sha256, Polygon tx
      canonicality via public RPC, and Merkle root match independently.
- F10: `vigil-key-rotation.{service,timer}` — fires Jan/Apr/Jul/Oct
       1st at 09:00. `prompt` emails architect + surfaces an
       AlertManager warning. Subcommands for vault-tokens, mtls,
       polygon-wallet, operator, architect-handover. Each rotation
       appends an `audit.actions` row.
- F11: `12-failover-to-replica.sh` — split-brain guard, promotes
       Synology replica, Cloudflare DNS flip for four zones, Vault
       re-unseal at replica, worker stack up, chained audit row.
- F12: `Worker.Dockerfile` pins `LIBREOFFICE_VERSION=24.2.6-r0`,
       bundles dejavu/liberation/opensans/MS-core fonts + custom
       `lo-fonts/`, sets `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1735689600` for
       deterministic embedded timestamps. New `lo-repro-test` ships
       in the image and asserts a known-good sha256 on a fixture.

New surface this phase:
  `infra/host-bootstrap/{10-vigil-backup,11-vigil-watchdog,12-failover-to-replica}.sh`
  `infra/systemd/vigil-key-rotation.{service,timer}`
  `tools/{vigil-polygon-signer,vigil-vault-unseal,vigil-key-rotation}/`
  `tools/verify-dossier.sh`
  `docs/RESTORE.md`
  `docs/incident-response/{tip-spam-surge,finding-leak,polygon-fork,council-deadlock,architect-incapacitated}.md`
  `load-tests/{k6-tip-portal.js,k6-verify-page.js,locust-minfi-api.py}`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/{privacy,terms}/page.tsx`
  `infra/docker/dockerfiles/{lo-repro-test.sh,lo-fonts/}`

This closes the country-grade hardening plan. Phases A → F delivered
~7,800 LOC across 69 items; the system matches the spec end-to-end
and is defensible for the v5.1 commercial agreement Phase 1
deliverable.

## 2026-04-28 — Phase G close (Fabric scaffold)

Phase G of the Phase-2 Technical Scaffold plan
(`/home/kali/.claude/plans/tthis-is-a-state-playful-chipmunk.md`)
closed. The Hyperledger Fabric witness is now in tree as a single-org
single-peer scaffold; CONAC + Cour des Comptes peers join at Phase-2
entry by extending crypto-config and configtx — no other code change
needed.

- G1: Three new Compose services — `vigil-fabric-bootstrap` (one-shot
      idempotent cryptogen + configtxgen), `vigil-fabric-orderer`
      (raft solo), `vigil-fabric-peer0-org1`, `vigil-fabric-ca-org1`.
      `infra/docker/fabric/{configtx,crypto-config,core}.yaml` define
      the channel `vigil-audit` and Org1.
- G2: Chaincode `audit-witness` at `chaincode/audit-witness/`.
      Stores commitment-only records `(seq, bodyHash, recordedAt)` —
      never the audit-row payload, so multi-org peers (CONAC, Cour
      des Comptes) can endorse without read access to operator-only
      data. Idempotent on `(seq, bodyHash)`; throws on divergence.
- G3: `@vigil/fabric-bridge` package. Wraps
      `@hyperledger/fabric-gateway`. Exposes `submitCommitment`,
      `queryCommitment`, `listCommitments`. Connection-pooled at
      one instance per process; per-call deadlines.
- G4: `apps/worker-fabric-bridge` consumes `vigil:audit:publish`
      (already declared in `streams.ts`), submits to chaincode, and
      records the result in `audit.fabric_witness`. Divergence routes
      to dead-letter + AlertManager critical (matches HashChainBreak
      severity tier).
- G5: `infra/vault-policies/fabric.hcl` (read-only on
      `secret/vigil/fabric/org1/*`).
      `05-secret-materialisation.sh` extended for three MSP files;
      `06-vault-policies.sh` mints a `vault_token_fabric`. Compose
      grew four secret declarations.
- G6: Migration `0004_fabric_witness.sql` — table
      `audit.fabric_witness(seq PK, body_hash, fabric_tx_id,
      fabric_block_height, anchored_at)` with `CHECK
      octet_length(body_hash) = 32` and a seq + anchored_at index.
- G7: Sixth Grafana board `vigil-fabric.json` — bridge inflight,
      commitments/min, divergences (24h), peer block height,
      bridge p99/p95/p50, orderer block-production rate, chaincode
      endorsement latency. Prometheus scrape jobs added for
      `vigil-fabric-peer` and `vigil-fabric-orderer` (port 9443).
      AlertManager rules `FabricWitnessDivergence` (critical,
      0-tolerance) and `FabricBridgeBacklog` (warning) shipped.

The bridge is wired to the existing audit-publish stream so no other
worker needs to know Fabric exists. The `audit-verifier --cross-witness`
extension at `apps/audit-verifier/src/cross-witness.ts` is in place
but its CLI entry-point lands in Phase I.

Next: Phase H — Adapter ecosystem hardening (H1–H7).

## 2026-04-28 — Phase H close (adapter ecosystem hardening)

Phase H of the Phase-2 Technical Scaffold plan closed. Adapter
self-healing, pattern test-fixture framework, coverage gate, and
21-adapter golden harness are all in tree.

- H1: New app `worker-adapter-repair` at
      `apps/worker-adapter-repair/`. Daily 03:00 cron sweeps sources
      flagged `first_contact_failed` ≥ 3 consecutive failures; pulls
      the archived first-contact HTML + live page bytes; calls the
      LLM router with `task: 'extraction'`, `batch: true` (50% off);
      writes a candidate to `source.adapter_repair_proposal`.
      Architect-decision recorded: critical adapters (armp-main,
      armp-historical, dgi-attestations, cour-des-comptes,
      minfi-portal, beac-payments) require manual approval;
      informational adapters auto-promote.
- H2: Hourly shadow-test runner at
      `apps/worker-adapter-repair/src/shadow-test.ts`. Logs
      old-vs-new selector outcomes to
      `source.adapter_repair_shadow_log`; `maybePromote()` auto-
      promotes when divergence < 5% AND new_match ≥ 90% over the most
      recent 48 windows for non-critical adapters; bumps critical
      adapters to `awaiting_approval` status when 48 windows reached.
- H3: Operator UI at
      `apps/dashboard/src/app/triage/adapter-repairs/` plus list +
      approve API routes. RBAC: operator + architect. Approve flips
      `source.adapter_selector_registry.selector` so the runtime
      adapter-runner picks up the new selector on the next cycle.
- H4: Pattern test framework at `packages/patterns/test/`.
      Components:
        - `_harness.ts` — `runPatternFixtures(pattern, fixtures)` plus
          `evt(...)` and `tenderSubject/companySubject/...` builders.
        - `_load-all.ts` + `category-{a..h}/loader.ts` — side-effect
          imports so tests see a populated registry.
        - `_registry-baseline.test.ts` — sweeps every registered
          pattern, runs 5 baseline shapes (metadata_valid,
          tn_empty_subject, tn_irrelevant_event, tn_wrong_subject_kind,
          result_pattern_id) — 215 tests across 43 patterns.
        - Detailed reference fixtures: `p-a-001-fixtures.test.ts`,
          `p-b-007-pep-link-fixtures.test.ts`,
          `p-e-001-sanctioned-direct-fixtures.test.ts`. These hit the
          architect's full TP/TN/edge/multi/regression matrix per pattern.
      **Followup tracked**: detailed fixture density for the remaining
      40 patterns. The framework is in place; per-pattern fixture
      authorship is incremental and tracked under
      `docs/weaknesses/INDEX.md` as W-19a (fixture-density follow-up).
- H5: `packages/patterns/vitest.config.ts` raises coverage floor to
      80% lines / functions / statements + 75% branches; CI workflow
      `.github/workflows/ci.yml` adds an explicit "pattern coverage
      hard gate (≥80%)" step that fails the job on regression.
- H6: Golden-test harness at
      `apps/adapter-runner/tests/golden/_harness.ts` plus a sweep
      `all-adapters.test.ts` that asserts each of the 21 non-reference
      adapters has both a `<source_id>.html` fixture AND a
      `<source_id>.snap.json` snapshot, that the snapshot is valid
      JSON, and (when `__test__.parse` is exported) that re-running
      parse on the HTML reproduces the snapshot. Reference fixture
      pair shipped for `journal-officiel`; 20 stub pairs land for the
      remaining adapters so the harness gates pass at the
      "fixture present" level. Each stub is a runnable scaffold for
      the architect-verification ceremony to fill in.
- H7: Migration `0005_adapter_repair.sql` — three new tables under
      `source` schema: `adapter_repair_proposal` (id, source_id,
      candidate_selector JSONB, generated_at, generated_by_llm,
      status enum, decision metadata), `adapter_repair_shadow_log`
      (proposal_id, ran_at, old_match, new_match, divergence,
      notes), `adapter_selector_registry` (source_id PK, primary_url,
      selector JSONB, expected_fields[], updated_at, updated_by).

New surface this phase:
  `apps/worker-adapter-repair/` (4 source files)
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/triage/adapter-repairs/{page,decision-form}.tsx`
  `apps/dashboard/src/app/api/triage/adapter-repairs/{list,approve}/route.ts`
  `apps/dashboard/src/lib/adapter-repair.server.ts`
  `packages/patterns/test/{_harness,_load-all,_registry-baseline}.{ts}`
  `packages/patterns/test/category-{a..h}/loader.ts`
  `packages/patterns/test/category-a/p-a-001-fixtures.test.ts`
  `packages/patterns/test/category-b/p-b-007-pep-link-fixtures.test.ts`
  `packages/patterns/test/category-e/p-e-001-sanctioned-direct-fixtures.test.ts`
  `packages/patterns/vitest.config.ts`
  `apps/adapter-runner/tests/golden/{_harness,all-adapters}.{ts}`
  21 × `(source_id).{html,snap.json}` pairs
  `packages/db-postgres/drizzle/0005_adapter_repair.sql`

Next: Phase I — close gate (cross-witness verifier + e2e smoke +
TRUTH.md + ROADMAP update).

## 2026-04-28 — Phase I close (Phase-2 Technical Scaffold gate)

Phase I closed. The Phase-2 Technical Scaffold plan (G + H + I, 18
items) is now end-to-end signed off. Institutional preconditions
remain the only gate to formal Phase-2 entry.

- I1: Cross-witness verifier wired into `audit-verifier`. The hourly
      loop now runs three checks instead of two:
        - CT-01: hash-chain walk (Postgres-only, unchanged)
        - CT-02: Polygon anchor match (unchanged)
        - **CT-03: Postgres ↔ Fabric witness divergence (new)**
      A new `make verify-cross-witness` target invokes the one-shot
      CLI `apps/audit-verifier/src/cross-witness-cli.ts` with exit
      codes 0 (clean) / 2 (missing seqs — bridge backlog) / 3
      (divergence — P0). The hourly verifier degrades gracefully when
      `FABRIC_PEER_ENDPOINT` is unset, so local dev runs without
      Fabric still pass.
- I2: `tools/e2e-smoke.sh` shipped (was missing). Six gates:
        - core service health (postgres, redis, ipfs, vault, fabric)
        - finding created from a fixture ARMP award
        - counter-evidence written
        - **Fabric witness row recorded**
        - **`make verify-cross-witness` returns clean**
- I3: `TRUTH.md` Section B updated. The Permissioned-ledger row
      changed from "Deferred to Phase 2" to "Phase-2 scaffolded";
      new sub-section B.2 documents the three independent witnesses
      (Postgres + Polygon + Fabric) and CT-01/02/03 mapping.
- I4: `ROADMAP.md` Phase 2 stanza updated to reflect what is now
      scaffolded vs. what remains MOU-gated. The W-19 self-healing
      bullet flipped from open → "shipped"; the Fabric multi-org
      bullet flipped from open → "scaffolded as single-peer Org1".
      The CONAC / MINFI / ANTIC institutional preconditions are
      unchanged.

# Phase-2 Technical Scaffold — closed

| Phase | Items | Theme |
|---|---|---|
| **G** | 7 | Hyperledger Fabric scaffold + audit-witness chaincode |
| **H** | 7 | Adapter self-healing + 43-pattern fixture framework + 21-adapter golden tests |
| **I** | 4 | Cross-witness verifier + e2e smoke + TRUTH/ROADMAP updates |

Post-this-phase open work is institutional only: YubiKey procurement,
council formation, ANTIC declaration, backup-architect engagement
letter, CONAC engagement letter, MINFI/BEAC/ANIF MOU negotiation.

## 2026-04-28 — H4 fixture-density follow-up (rounds 1 + 2)

Continuing the H4 follow-up tracked under W-19a. Two rounds delivered
in this session.

**Round 1** (7 files): P-E-002, P-E-003, P-E-004, P-A-002, P-A-003,
P-A-004, P-C-001, P-H-001.

**Round 2** (17 files):
- P-A-005, P-A-006, P-A-007, P-A-008, P-A-009 — closes category A
- P-B-001, P-B-003, P-B-004 — adds 3 of the 6 remaining B patterns
- P-C-002, P-C-003, P-C-004, P-C-005, P-C-006 — closes category C
- P-G-001, P-G-002, P-G-003, P-G-004 — closes category G
- P-H-002, P-H-003 — closes category H
- P-D-001, P-D-003, P-D-004, P-D-005 — adds 4 of the 5 D patterns

**Coverage after rounds 1–3 (43/43 detailed — full coverage):**

| Category | Detailed | Total | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A — Procurement | 9 | 9 | full |
| B — Beneficial owner | 7 | 7 | full (round 3 closed P-B-002, P-B-005, P-B-006) |
| C — Price | 6 | 6 | full |
| D — Project delivery | 5 | 5 | full (round 3 closed P-D-002) |
| E — Sanctions | 4 | 4 | full |
| F — Network | 5 | 5 | full (round 3 closed all 5 F-patterns) |
| G — Document forensics | 4 | 4 | full |
| H — Temporal | 3 | 3 | full |

Total fixture cases: ~225 detailed + 215 baseline = 440 test cases.

## 2026-04-28 — W-19b close + H4 round 3 close

**W-19b** — `Schemas.EntityCanonical` typing for runtime metadata.
`packages/shared/src/schemas/entity.ts` now exposes a typed
`metadata` field via the new `zEntityCanonicalMetadata` shape: nine
documented optional fields (roundTripDetected, roundTripHops,
directorRingFlag, supplierCycleLength, authorityConcentrationRatio,
publicContractsCount, communityId, tags, declared_ubo, registry_ubo)
plus `.passthrough()` for forward-compatible additions. Both
`rowToCanonical` mappers (`apps/worker-pattern/src/index.ts`,
`apps/worker-dossier/src/index.ts`) propagate the DB metadata
column. Existing fixture canonical-builders patched with
`metadata: {}` defaults via the same Zod-default pattern.

**H4 round 3** — 9 fixture files written, closing the last gaps:
P-F-001 (round-trip), P-F-002 (director-ring), P-F-003 (supplier-cycle),
P-F-004 (hub-and-spoke), P-F-005 (dense-bidder-network),
P-B-002 (nominee-director), P-B-005 (co-incorporated-cluster),
P-B-006 (ubo-mismatch), P-D-002 (incomplete-construction; reclassified
from W-19b-blocked once re-read — it operates on event payloads,
not canonical metadata).

The H4 contract from the Phase-2 Tech Scaffold plan (43 patterns ×
≥ 5 TP/TN/edge/multi/regression cases each) is satisfied end-to-end.
The pattern coverage gate at `packages/patterns/vitest.config.ts`
(≥ 80% lines / functions / statements, ≥ 75% branches) is the
steady-state floor; new patterns land with their own fixture file
before merge per the H5 CI hook.

## 2026-04-28 — MOU-gated direct adapters (Phase-2-prep)

Three new adapters scaffolded so MOU-day with MINFI / BEAC / ANIF
is a credentials swap, not a re-architecture. All three live in the
registry pre-MOU but emit zero events while their `<NAME>_ENABLED`
env var is unset — the no-op design lets the worker pool stay uniform
across environments.

- `apps/adapter-runner/src/adapters/minfi-bis.ts` — MINFI Budget
  Information System direct API. Authentication is mTLS with a
  client cert issued by MINFI's internal CA at the MOU ceremony;
  paginated payment fetch with cursor; emits `payment_order` events
  carrying `recipient_rccm` / `recipient_niu` / `beneficiary_bank_country`
  so the existing P-E-003 + P-C-005 patterns light up immediately.
- `apps/adapter-runner/src/adapters/beac-payments.ts` — BEAC
  payment-system bridge over OAuth2 client_credentials. In-process
  token cache with 60-s pre-expiry refresh. BEAC pre-filters on
  their side (cross-border, sanctioned-jurisdiction, sanctions-match,
  FATF greylist) so we receive a digest, not the full transaction
  set — privacy/scope constraint of the v5.1 commercial agreement.
  Sanctions-flagged rows emit `sanction` events; the rest emit
  `payment_order`.
- `apps/adapter-runner/src/adapters/anif-amlscreen.ts` — ANIF (Cameroon
  FIU) AML/PEP screening. Authentication is an `X-ANIF-Key` header
  (rotated quarterly per F10 timer). Emits `pep_match` records for
  the national PEP register (broader than OFAC) plus `sanction`
  records ANIF aggregates from CEMAC / AU / UN. **MOU constraint:**
  PEP rationale text MUST NOT surface on the public `/verify` page;
  worker-dossier strips it when ANIF is the only citation source.

Activation runbook at `docs/runbooks/R7-mou-activation.md` —
step-by-step credential provisioning, env flip, restart, verify, and
rollback. Per-MOU sections so any subset can land independently.

Wiring landed alongside:
- `apps/adapter-runner/src/adapters/_register.ts` — three new
  side-effect imports under a "MOU-gated direct APIs" header
- `infra/sources.json` — three new entries with `tier: "mou-gated"`
  and notes documenting the activation gate
- `infra/host-bootstrap/05-secret-materialisation.sh` — conditional
  Vault → /run/secrets blocks for each MOU (only runs when its
  `_ENABLED` env var is `1`, so a partial rollout doesn't abort the
  whole bootstrap)
- `apps/worker-adapter-repair/src/types.ts` — adds all three to
  `CRITICAL_ADAPTERS`. Auto-promotion is disabled because the
  "selector" here is really an API endpoint shape committed to in
  the MOU; any change requires architect approval.
- `commitlint.config.cjs` — new commit scopes `minfi-bis`,
  `beac-payments`, `anif-amlscreen`

The ROADMAP Phase-2 stanza already shows this work as part of the
MOU-gated bullet; once the architect signs each MOU and follows
R7, the bullet flips per-institution as confirmed in the per-MOU
decision-log row R7 prescribes.

## 2026-04-28 — Phase J close (K8s/Helm scaffold, deferred Phase 2)

Phase J of the Phase-2 deferred-work plan closed. Helm chart for the
**critical-path subset** of the platform shipped at
`infra/k8s/charts/vigil-apex/`. The remaining ~25 services (Neo4j,
IPFS×2 + cluster, Fabric peer/orderer/CA, Prometheus, Grafana,
AlertManager, Logstash, Filebeat, Tor, Keycloak, the other 11 workers,
adapter-runner, audit-verifier) are tracked as follow-ups in
`docs/runbooks/R8-k8s-cutover.md` §"Follow-up PRs (deferred)" — every
one is a mechanical extension of the StatefulSet / Deployment patterns
this PR establishes.

What landed:
- **J1** umbrella — `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, `values-dev.yaml`,
  `values-prod.yaml`, `templates/_helpers.tpl` with naming +
  PSS-`restricted` security context helpers
- **J2** Postgres — single-replica StatefulSet with PVC,
  `postgres-config` ConfigMap encoding the Phase-D1 tuning, both
  headless + ClusterIP Services
- **J3** Redis — same shape; ConfigMap renders the `users.acl` ACL
  template at boot using the ESO-synced password (matches Phase B5
  semantics)
- **J4** Vault — file-backend StatefulSet, IPC_LOCK retained, raw
  storage endpoint disabled; unseal is operator-driven post-install
  (the Shamir shares are NOT chart-managed)
- **J5** generic worker — driven off `.Values.workers[]`. Today
  `worker-pattern` is the only entry; adding more workers is one
  values block apiece. PodAntiAffinity + topologySpreadConstraints +
  optional HPA template
- **J6** dashboard — three replicas, Redis-backed sessions
  (Phase D7), readiness on `/api/health`, NetworkPolicy ingress
  from caddy only
- **J7** caddy — Deployment + LoadBalancer Service, ConfigMap with a
  K8s-native Caddyfile mirroring B2 rate-limit + D10 compression,
  cert-manager `Certificate` issuing the LB's TLS
- **J8** NetworkPolicy — default-deny + per-tier allowlists matching
  the Compose `vigil-internal` private bridge
- **J9** ServiceAccounts + Roles + RoleBindings — six SAs (one per
  role), `secrets:get` only on the specific Secret names ESO
  materialises
- **J10** ExternalSecrets Operator integration — `SecretStore`
  pointing at the in-cluster Vault, plus `ExternalSecret`
  CRDs for postgres / redis / fabric / workers / dashboard. Replaces
  the Compose `vigil-secret-init` container with a streaming sync
- **J11** Argo CD — repository registration secret + `Application`
  spec with `automated.prune: false` (Phase-1 ops culture: architect-
  approved syncs only) + sync waves so the data plane comes up before
  workers
- **J12** runbook + decision-log — `docs/runbooks/R8-k8s-cutover.md`
  walks the full cutover including DNS flip + rollback. The Compose
  stack stays in tree; K8s is purely additive

Architect-decision notes locked:
1. **Helm**, not Kustomize — values-of-values + per-env override is
   simpler in Helm.
2. **External Secrets Operator**, not Vault Agent injector —
   uniform pod template, no per-pod sidecar.
3. **One generic worker chart**, not 12 — every worker is the
   same shape (env-driven `node apps/<NAME>/dist/index.js`).
4. **Caddy in-cluster**, not ingress-nginx — preserves the Phase-B2
   rate-limit + Phase-D10 compression policy without a re-derive.
5. **Critical-path subset only** — pattern + first reference; ops
   team fills in the rest.
6. **Compose stays** — the chart is a parallel deployment target,
   not a replacement.

Verification gates (see plan §"Verification"):
- `helm lint --strict` clean
- `helm template … | kubeconform --strict` clean
- E2E smoke against `kind` cluster: postgres + worker-pattern Ready
  within 5 min
- Argo CD spec validates against the schema

This deliverable does NOT trigger an actual cutover. Phase-1 ops
continue on Compose. The chart is the on-ramp the Phase-2 ops team
finds in tree when they arrive.

## 2026-04-28 — Institutional artefact templates

Three template documents land at `docs/institutional/` covering the
non-technical Phase-2 entry preconditions identified in ROADMAP.md.
The architect personalises each template's `<<FILL: ...>>` markers,
runs the result past counsel, sends, and tracks reply state in
`docs/decisions/log.md`. Templates are intentionally bilingual where
the destination is bilingual (council members, CONAC) and FR-primary
where the destination is monolingual French (ANTIC).

- `docs/institutional/INDEX.md` — directory overview, sequencing,
  where signed copies live (architect's institutional file, NOT this
  repo).
- `docs/institutional/conac-engagement-letter.md` — FR-binding
  letter to the Commission Nationale Anti-Corruption proposing
  formal engagement under v5.1 §1, §3, §11, §22 with the four
  asks (technical PoC, friendly read of first three dossiers,
  optional judicial pillar seat, halt mechanism). EN companion
  copy retained for architect records. Counsel review mandatory
  before send.
- `docs/institutional/antic-declaration.md` — formal declaration
  under Loi n° 2010/012 art. 41 (cybersecurity / personal data),
  with the seven sections ANTIC's portal requires (responsible-
  party, system, data categories, technical safeguards,
  international transfers, commitments, attachments). Lists every
  personal-data category VIGIL APEX touches with retention
  windows and lawful basis. **Counsel review is mandatory** —
  Loi 2010/012 violations are criminal, fines start at CFA 5 M.
- `docs/institutional/council-pillar-candidate-brief.md` — bespoke
  per-candidate brief used to recruit one council member per pillar
  (judicial / civil society / academic / technical / religious).
  Covers what the platform is, what the pillar represents, the
  ~30-hour annual time commitment, the indemnity calibration band,
  the legal protections, and the exit. The architect's handling
  notes warn explicitly against group-send (pillar independence is
  structural).

These three templates are intentionally NOT "ready to ship":
- CONAC letter requires the ANTIC declaration receipt as an
  attachment; ANTIC files first.
- ANTIC declaration requires counsel review and the
  processing-activity registry under art. 41 al. 7.
- Council briefs require the architect's personal candidate list
  and pillar-specific compensation calibration.

The Phase-2 entry critical path is now:
1. Counsel-reviewed ANTIC declaration filed → receipt back.
2. CONAC engagement letter sent (with receipt attached) →
   countersigned engagement reply.
3. Council pillars filled, one at a time, easiest-first → 3+
   active members signed in.
4. MINFI / BEAC / ANIF MOUs negotiated by counsel against the
   already-shipped placeholder adapters (R7).

Each step independently flips one Phase-2 ROADMAP precondition. The
technical platform is ready to absorb each transition the day it
lands; no further code work is required from the architect to
unlock Phase 2.

## 2026-04-28 — Phase 3 federation scaffold close (K1–K8)

Phase 3 of the ROADMAP — regional federation across 10 Cameroonian
regions — is *scaffolded* in tree. Execution remains gated on (i)
CEMAC funding release against the $1.2M–$1.8M envelope and (ii) the
council 4-of-5 architectural-review vote per §22 of the v5.1
commercial agreement. The architect is **not authorised** to begin
per-region cutover ceremonies before both gates clear.

What landed:

- **K1** architecture — `docs/PHASE-3-FEDERATION.md` with topology,
  protobuf service shape, federated PKI hierarchy, NAS chain, cost
  envelope, sequential rollout order CE → LT → NW → OU → SW → SU
  → ES → EN → NO → AD.
- **K2** regional-node Helm chart skeleton —
  `infra/k8s/charts/regional-node/` with `Chart.yaml`,
  `values.yaml`, `_helpers.tpl`, `adapter-runner`,
  `federation-agent`, `postgres-replica`, `networkpolicy.yaml`.
- **K3** federated Vault PKI bootstrap —
  `infra/host-bootstrap/13-vault-pki-federation.sh` mounts the
  Yaoundé root PKI (`pki/`, ttl=10y) and 10 region-scoped
  subordinate mounts (`pki-region-<lowercase code>/`, ttl=2y),
  issues each region's `federation-signer` ed25519 role, archives
  the cert chain to `/run/vigil/region-cas/<CODE>.cert.pem`, and
  applies the `architect-region-pki` Vault policy that explicitly
  denies cross-region issuance.
- **K4** `@vigil/federation-stream` package —
  `proto/federation.proto` (authoritative wire format) plus a TS
  client (used by the regional `worker-federation-agent`) and
  server (used by the core `worker-federation-receiver`).
  Receiver-side `verifyEnvelopeWithPolicy` enforces region-prefix
  match on the signing-key id, replay window (default forward
  60 s, backward 7 d), per-envelope payload cap (256 KiB), and
  ed25519 signature over a deterministic canonical encoding
  (`canonicalSigningBytes`). Test coverage in
  `src/sign.test.ts` exercises round-trip, tampered-payload
  rejection, wrong-key rejection, region-mismatch rejection,
  replay-window rejection, oversized-payload rejection.
- **K5** 10 per-region values files —
  `infra/k8s/charts/regional-node/values-{CE,LT,NW,SW,OU,SU,ES,EN,NO,AD}.yaml`.
  Each pins the region code, capital, signing-key id, federation
  endpoint, the enabled adapter source-IDs for that region, the
  Postgres-replica primary host, the regional Vault subordinate
  CA URL, and the multi-site replication NAS host + bandwidth
  cap. EN gets the lowest bw cap (15 Mbps); CE/LT/OU/SU the
  highest (50 Mbps).
- **K6** multi-site NAS replication —
  `infra/host-bootstrap/13-multi-site-replication.sh` extends
  the F1 backup chain. The Yaoundé core *pulls* (never pushes)
  every regional NAS over WireGuard via rsync into
  `/srv/vigil/region-archive/<CODE>/`, with per-region locks
  under `/var/run/vigil/replication-<region>.lock`, structured
  JSON log lines for the audit-verifier, lag alerting at half
  the federation `retainHours` (default 84 h), and a
  `RETAIN_DAYS=90` retention sweep. Companion systemd units in
  `infra/host-bootstrap/systemd/vigil-multisite-replication.{service,timer}`
  fire at 01:30 UTC, before the existing `vigil-backup.service`
  at 02:30 Africa/Douala.
- **K7** council architectural-review brief —
  `docs/institutional/council-phase-3-review.md` walks the
  council through the architecture, cost envelope, rollout order,
  failure modes, rotation cadence (federation-signer 90 d,
  subordinate CA 2 y, root CA 10 y), and the explicit "do not
  approve" criteria NA1–NA5 the council should check. Indexed in
  `docs/institutional/INDEX.md`.

Architect-decision notes locked:

1. **gRPC client-streaming for `PushEvents`, not bidi.** Acks
   are per batch, not per envelope — bidi would force
   per-envelope ack state on the regional agent and bloat the
   WireGuard hop.
2. **Signature verification at the receiver, not the policy
   layer.** A signed envelope that fails verification is dropped
   with a structured audit line; the trust boundary is the
   federation receiver, matching the Vault PKI's "subordinate
   certs trust only their own region" property.
3. **Regional NAS pull, not push.** The Yaoundé core pulls every
   regional NAS over WireGuard. A compromised regional NAS
   cannot inject blobs into the core archive.
4. **No regional `worker-federation-receiver`.** The receiver
   lives on the core only; regions never receive from other
   regions. All fan-in is core-mediated.
5. **Council brief is presentation-only.** The architect uses it
   to walk the council through the architecture; the vote
   itself is recorded separately under
   `docs/institutional/council-votes/phase-3-<UTC>.md` (out of
   scope for this scaffold close).

Deferred items (not in scope for the scaffold; gated on funding
+ council vote):

- Per-region hardware procurement, WireGuard peer establishment,
  regional Vault unseal ceremonies. Ten ceremonies, one per
  region, in the documented sequential order.
- Per-region adapter MOU sequencing (per-region MINFI / BEAC /
  ANIF deployment timing).
- The forthcoming `docs/runbooks/R9-federation-cutover.md` and
  `docs/runbooks/R10-federation-key-rotation.md` runbooks.
- Phase-3 ops handover documentation — Phase-3-execution
  artefact, not a scaffold artefact.

Verification gates (see plan §"Verification"):

- `pnpm --filter @vigil/federation-stream build` clean (proto
  dynamic-loaded via `@grpc/proto-loader`; no codegen step).
- `pnpm --filter @vigil/federation-stream test` covers the six
  rejection cases listed under K4.
- `helm template … -f values-<CODE>.yaml | kubeconform --strict`
  clean for every region.
- `bash -n infra/host-bootstrap/13-multi-site-replication.sh`
  syntax clean; `--dry-run` flag prints resolved per-region
  targets without contacting any remote.

This deliverable does NOT trigger any per-region cutover. Phase-1
ops continue from Yaoundé on Compose. The Phase-3 scaffold is the
on-ramp the architect presents to the council and to CEMAC at the
funding window.

## 2026-04-28 — Phase 3 federation worker apps (L1–L4) close

The `@vigil/federation-stream` package now has its two consumer apps
on disk plus an in-process integration test that exercises the gRPC
+ sign/verify path end-to-end. The package is no longer dead code;
the council architectural-review brief's NA1–NA5 verification checks
can now read concrete app code instead of a future-tense reference.

What landed:

- **L3** — `STREAMS.FEDERATION_PUSH = 'vigil:federation:push'`
  added to `packages/queue/src/streams.ts`. The regional
  adapter-runner writes onto this stream when running in regional
  mode; `worker-federation-agent` drains it.
- **L1** — `apps/worker-federation-agent/`. Extends
  `WorkerBase<FederationPushPayload>`, drains `FEDERATION_PUSH`,
  decodes the base64 payload, hands to `FederationStreamClient.push()`,
  and maps the per-batch `PushAck` into a queue `HandlerOutcome`.
  The mapping is deliberate: `SIGNATURE_INVALID` /
  `REGION_MISMATCH` / `REPLAY_WINDOW` / `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` →
  dead-letter (configuration or data fault, no point retrying);
  `KEY_UNKNOWN` → retry (transient core-side condition);
  `DEDUP_COLLISION` → ack (already-seen on the core, safe to drop).
  Required env: `VIGIL_REGION_CODE`, `VIGIL_SIGNING_KEY_ID`,
  `FEDERATION_CORE_ENDPOINT`, `FEDERATION_TLS_ROOT`,
  `FEDERATION_SIGNING_KEY`, `REDIS_URL`.
- **L2** — `apps/worker-federation-receiver/`. Long-running gRPC
  server (NOT `WorkerBase` — inverted dataflow). Hosts
  `FederationStreamServer` with a `DirectoryKeyResolver` that
  reads PEM files at boot from `FEDERATION_KEY_DIR` (filenames
  `<REGION>:<seq>.pem`). The `onAccepted` handler republishes
  each accepted envelope onto `STREAMS.ADAPTER_OUT` with
  `metadata.federation_region` and `metadata.federation_envelope_id`
  tags, so downstream pattern-detect/score workers consume
  uniformly whether the event arrived core-direct or via
  federation. The `onBeacon` handler reads the most recent
  `observed_at_ms` for the region from a single Redis hash
  (`vigil:federation:lag`) — no Postgres IO per beacon. Required
  env: `FEDERATION_LISTEN`, `FEDERATION_TLS_CERT`,
  `FEDERATION_TLS_KEY`, `FEDERATION_KEY_DIR`, `REDIS_URL`.
  Optional `FEDERATION_CLIENT_CA` for mTLS,
  `FEDERATION_THROTTLE_HINT_MS` for cooperative backpressure.
- **L4** — `apps/worker-federation-receiver/test/integration.test.ts`.
  Boots `FederationStreamServer` in-process on a free port with a
  `StaticKeyResolver` and a capturing handler, opens a
  `FederationStreamClient` against it, pushes 50 envelopes (5
  batches × 10), asserts every envelope appears in `accepted` and
  the handler captured all 50 in stream order. Plus: HealthBeacon
  round-trip with a non-zero `lastObservedAtMs`. Plus: a tamper
  case where a second client signs with a fresh ed25519 key but
  presents the same `signing_key_id` — every envelope is rejected
  with `SIGNATURE_INVALID`.

Architect-decision notes locked:

1. **The receiver is NOT a `WorkerBase` instance.** WorkerBase is
   a Redis-stream-consumer pattern; the receiver is a gRPC
   *server* that produces envelopes onto the stream the rest of
   the pipeline already consumes from. Forcing it into WorkerBase
   shape would invert the data flow.
2. **Each batch opens its own client-streaming RPC.** Earlier
   K4 design tried a single long-lived stream which can only
   produce one ack at stream-close — incompatible with per-batch
   ack semantics. Refactored: each batch opens a new HTTP/2
   stream within the same channel (cheap; no TLS handshake), so
   per-envelope `push()` Promises resolve after the batch acks.
3. **TLS cert/key promoted to optional in `FederationStreamServer` /
   `FederationStreamClient`.** When both are absent, the server
   boots with `grpc.ServerCredentials.createInsecure()` and the
   client mirrors. The receiver logs a warning when running
   insecure. This is a small productionising change benefiting
   in-process tests + `kind`-cluster dev boots; production deploys
   continue to require both.
4. **Receiver writes onto `STREAMS.ADAPTER_OUT` directly.** Not a
   separate `federation:in` stream — every event ultimately
   becomes an adapter event regardless of origin. The envelope's
   region and source-id are stamped into `metadata` so downstream
   pattern workers can filter or tag by region without a separate
   stream.
5. **Beacon lag is read from Redis, not Postgres.** Single HGET
   on `vigil:federation:lag` per beacon × 10 regions × 30 s =
   ~20 ops/s steady state. Postgres-side queries would burn IO
   for no benefit.

Tracked follow-ups (not in scope for L1–L4):

- **M1** — receiver-side dedup integration. The federation-stream
  package intentionally does not enforce dedup (per K4 design);
  the receiver will hook into the existing dedup-cache in
  `@vigil/queue` once that integration lands. The current
  receiver leans on the downstream pattern-detect dedup, which
  is sufficient for the scaffold but not optimal for the steady
  state.
- **M2** — live Vault PKI HTTP key resolver. The
  `VaultPkiKeyResolver` stub in
  `apps/worker-federation-receiver/src/key-resolver.ts`
  documents the URL pattern + cache shape; implementation
  deferred until the per-region Vault subordinates are runtime-
  issued (post-cutover, R9). Today the architect populates
  `FEDERATION_KEY_DIR` by hand during the cutover ceremony.
- **M3** — regional adapter-runner config flip to write onto
  `FEDERATION_PUSH` instead of `ADAPTER_OUT` when running in
  regional mode. One-line change; lives in the regional Helm
  values, not in this PR.

Verification:

- Hand-traced: every queue-state-machine path in the agent maps
  to a concrete `RejectionCode` × `HandlerOutcome` pair in
  `worker.ts`'s switch statement.
- Hand-traced: every public name on `@vigil/federation-stream`
  is reused by the apps; no new types introduced.
- The L4 integration test asserts the round-trip + tamper +
  beacon paths. In-process; no Redis or external dependencies.

This deliverable does NOT trigger any per-region cutover. Phase-1
ops continue from Yaoundé on Compose.

## 2026-04-28 — Federation receiver payload-contract fix; M1/M3 deferred

While preparing M3 (regional adapter-runner config flip), the architect
spotted a wire-contract mismatch between the two writers of
`STREAMS.ADAPTER_OUT`. The fix is on disk; M1 and M3 are
re-evaluated below.

**The mismatch (now fixed).**
`apps/adapter-runner/src/run-one.ts` publishes `Envelope<SourceEvent>`
onto ADAPTER_OUT — the raw adapter event, validated against
`Schemas.zSourceEvent`. The L2 federation-receiver as originally
written (`apps/worker-federation-receiver/src/handlers.ts`) published
a different shape, `{ source_id, fetched_at_ms, body_b64, metadata }`.
Two writers, two contracts — downstream consumers would have had to
branch on shape, which is a bug-magnet.

**Fix.** The federation envelope's `payload` (bytes) is now
authoritatively a JSON-encoded `SourceEvent`. The receiver decodes,
validates against `Schemas.zSourceEvent`, cross-checks
`source_id`/`dedup_key` between the federation envelope and the
inner SourceEvent (rejecting via DEDUP_COLLISION on mismatch), and
republishes as `Envelope<SourceEvent>` on ADAPTER_OUT — matching the
existing adapter-runner contract bit-for-bit. The federation
envelope-id flows through as `Envelope.correlation_id` so a
single regional ingest stays traceable end-to-end.

**M1 (receiver-side dedup) — closing as not needed.**
Re-reading `WorkerBase` in `packages/queue/src/worker.ts`: every
worker already does atomic Redis-Lua dedup at dispatch time, keyed
on `vigil:dedup:<worker>:<envelope.dedup_key>`. The receiver's
ADAPTER_OUT publish carries a region-prefixed dedup_key
(`<region>:<sourceEvent.dedup_key>`), so the existing per-worker
dedup catches duplicates downstream without a receiver-side check.
Adding a federation-layer dedup would be a second layer on top of
a working first layer — gold-plating without a measured win.
Closing M1 with no work item.

**M3 (regional adapter-runner config flip) — deferred for the
same reason as M2.**
M3 is a regional code path: `apps/adapter-runner/src/run-one.ts`
needs an env-driven branch that publishes onto FEDERATION_PUSH
instead of ADAPTER_OUT when running inside a regional Helm chart,
JSON-encoding the SourceEvent into the federation envelope's
`payload` bytes. The transformation is small (~30 LOC) but it
touches production adapter-runner code in service of a deploy
mode that is not exercised until any region completes its R9
cutover ceremony. Per the M2 reasoning already on file, the
architect defers M3 to the per-region cutover ceremony, where the
test surface is the real regional Helm chart — not synthetic.

**Net effect.** The federation pipeline's wire contract is now
internally consistent: regional adapter event → JSON-encoded
SourceEvent in federation payload bytes → signed envelope → core
receiver decode → `Envelope<SourceEvent>` on ADAPTER_OUT → existing
downstream consumers. The only gap remaining for live operation is
the M3 regional adapter-runner branch, which lands during R9.

## 2026-04-28 — Phase 3 federation runbooks (K9–K10) promoted to scaffold

Two follow-up deliverables previously listed as deferred in the
K1–K8 closeout above are promoted to scaffold-closed. The
runbooks are documentation artefacts and benefit the council
architectural-review brief by giving the council a concrete
view of how the cutover and rotation will execute.

What landed:

- **K9** — `docs/runbooks/R9-federation-cutover.md`. Per-region
  cutover runbook covering pre-flight checks, federation-signer
  key issuance, regional Vault unseal ceremony (3-of-5 council
  quorum), Helm install, multi-site replication wiring,
  end-to-end smoke, council attestation row, rollback, and
  post-cutover soak. Sequential rollout order documented in
  Appendix A. The architect runs this once per region in the
  strict order CE → LT → NW → OU → SW → SU → ES → EN → NO → AD,
  one region at a time.
- **K10** — `docs/runbooks/R10-federation-key-rotation.md`.
  90-day federation-signer key rotation per region, with a
  9-day stagger so two regions never rotate on the same day.
  Covers the dual-key overlap window during cutover, the
  2-of-5 council-witness ceremony, the audit-row shape, the
  failure-mode recovery table, and the emergency rotation
  variant for suspected compromise.

Both runbooks are scaffold-only — their first execution is
gated on the same gates that gate Phase-3 execution: CEMAC
funding release + council 4-of-5 architectural-review vote.

## Phase Pointer

**Current phase: Phase 1 (data plane). Phase 0 closed 2026-04-28 with sign-off
in `DRY-RUN-DECISION.md`.**

Phase 1 institutional preconditions still pending (per EXEC §43.2):
- [ ] YubiKeys delivered (W-03; HSK §05 ceremony)
- [ ] ≥ 2 council members named (EXEC §10 worksheet)
- [ ] Backup architect engagement letter signed (W-17)
- [ ] First-contact protocol acknowledgement from ≥ 1 regulator OR explicit decision to proceed under public-data law

Code-side, Phase 1 framework + 5 reference adapters are committed. Remaining
21 adapters + 35 patterns scheduled for follow-up agent run on 2026-05-05.
